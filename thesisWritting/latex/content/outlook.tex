To create a first release version the prototype more user feedback would need to be implemented. Currently the prototype only shows a console message when an error occurs during the export or saving of a pattern and and user feedback for successful deletion and the changing of a pattern name is missing. Currently the prototype's \gls{UI} is optimized for use on a Nexus 9 Android tablet, smaller screen sizes would need to be supported to guarantee a consistent \gls{UI} across all devices. 

Further features stated in the requirements and gathered from the user tests would be to support stitches wider than one cell for knitting techniques that span across multiple stitches, e.g. the instruction to \gls{k2tog}. The wish for a repeat counter next to the row counter has also been expressed during user tests, for cases where a certain pattern has to be repeated, e.g. as often done in scraves.

It is also possible to integrate the functions of the prototype into an app designed to manage everything connected to knitting projects. Such and app could allow the user to keep an inventory of all the needles and yarns in his possession, keep track of a shopping list for future projects and allow the input of written instructions. The option to add pictures to a pattern, either taken directly on the device or added from disk, as well as to share a pattern from inside the app, e.g. via E-mail or DropBox, would also fit well into such an app.
