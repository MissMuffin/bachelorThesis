CREDITS:

A big thank-you goes out to my lovely and talented testers:  Kristle Chester (on Ravelry as "kcyarn"), Terry Coriell, and Katherine Tatis.  Their volunteer efforts made the fonts much better than it was when I started.  Volunteer suggestions included (but are not limited to) making the version without borders,  doing additional mapping to accommodate German keyboards, and asking if I knew of any compatible alphabetic fonts that would closely match the point size of the Knitting Font (for suggested free fonts, see https://sites.google.com/site/kauriknitsfont).  The input these testers provided really improved the quality of these fonts, and I am so grateful to them for their help!
